Abstract

   Network Tokens is a method to securely transfer claims between
   endpoints and a network to drive or assist network policy.  They are
   inserted by endpoints in existing protocols, interpreted by trusted
   networks, and may be signed or encrypted to meet security and privacy
   requirements.  Network Tokens can be represented as JSON Web Tokens,
   CBOR Web Tokens, or other available formats.  They can be used to
   expose and access a variety of network services such as firewall
   whitelists, QoS, and zero-rating services.

1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7519] and CBOR Web Token (CWT) [RFC8392]
   are standardized security token formats that have found use in OAuth
   2.0, OpenID Connect, and Internet of Things deployments, among other
   applications.  JWT and CWT use JSON Object Signature and Encryption
   (JOSE) and COBR Object Signature and Encryption (COSE) technologies
   to secure the contents of tokens, which essentially are a set of
   claims represented in JSON or CBOR.

Internet-Draft                networktokens                   April 2020


   This specification motivates and describes the use of tokens - named
   network tokens - as a method to securely transfer claims between
   endpoints and a network to drive and/or assist network policy.
   Network tokens are inserted by endpoints in existing protocols,
   interpreted by trusted networks, and may be signed or encrypted to
   meet a variety of security and privacy requirements.  They can be
   encoded as JSON Web Tokens, CBOR Web Tokens, or other available
   formats.  Network tokens can be used to expose and access a variety
   of network services such as firewall whitelists, QoS, and zero-rating
   services.

2.  Terminology

   o  End Users: We use the term "end user" to broadly characterize a
      role that has control over an endpoint.  This can be an individual
      user, an enterprise, an Operating System, or an application.

3.  Motivation

   o  Discuss existing alternatives through DiffServ and DPI

   o  Requirements from different perspectives (network operator,
      regulator, app developer, user)

4.  Network Token Overview

   A network token is a small piece of data that end users attach to
   their packets to access a whitelist-based network service.  As
   packets flow through the network, intermediate nodes detect tokens,
   interpret them, and apply the desired service to the packets that
   carry them (and possibly to all other packets from the same flow).

   Network tokens are always interpreted by a network operator.  Token
   generation depends on the use case and trust relationship between the
   different entities involved.  For example, tokens might be generated
   by the network who distributes it to eligible end-users on-demand.
   Alternatively, the operator can enable users to generate multiple
   tokens themselves, or application providers might generate tokens and
   tell operators how to interpret them.

   To prevent unauthorized third-parties from replaying, spoofing, or
   interpreting a token, tokens may be signed and encrypted, in ways
   described below.  Network tokens can use custom or existing
   representation formats, like JWT [RFC7515] or CWT [RFC7516].
   Section XX discusses example tokens for specific usecases.

   Network tokens do not dictate a dedicated header or protocol to be
   inserted.  Instead, they are incorporated as options and extensions



Yiakoumis               Expires October 15, 2020                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                networktokens                   April 2020


   into a variety of existing protocols.  For example, network tokens
   can be carried as TLS Client and Server Hello extensions during a TLS
   handshake, as IPv6 destination or Hop by Hop Options, or as
   attributes during a STUN-enabled flow setup.  Network tokens are
   largely opaque to the protocols that carry them.  Section XX
   discusses implementation details for inserting tokens, and Section XX
   lists recommended IANA registry changes for TLS, STUN, and IPv6.

   The distribution of tokens is out of scope for this document.

5.  Contents and Representation

   The contents of a network token fulfil three main goals:

   o  communicate the desired information between an endpoint and the
      network (e.g., the name of an application, or a user key to
      request low-latency services)

   o  prevent unauthorized parties from replaying or using these tokens
      to inadvertently access network services (e.g., through the use of
      timestamps, expiration time, nonces)

   o  digitally sign and/or encrypt a token to meet privacy and security
      requirements

   Network operators can define their own structure to represent tokens,
   for example through pre-defined byte sequences or a list of TLV-
   encoded fields.  Alternatively, tokens can use JOSE and COSE
   technologies for representation, as they already provide a framework
   to securely communicate information between different entities.  The
   actual representation and contents of a token should take into
   consideration the capabilities of the network to process them (i.e,
   what cryptographic functionality can the network support), length in
   terms of header space, and requirements for integrity protection,
   privacy preservation, and attack scenarios.

   Examples in this document will use JWT to represent tokens, as they
   are well understood by the community and easily read by humans.
   Translation to a different representation format should be straight
   forward.

5.1.  Network Token Common fields

   Network tokens can have arbitrary fields (or claims).  The fields
   defined below, while not mandatory, provide a starting point for a
   set of useful, interoperable fields.  Network services using network
   tokens should define which specific fields they use and whether they
   are required or optional.  Several of the fields listed below are



Yiakoumis               Expires October 15, 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                networktokens                   April 2020


   already registered as part of JWT and CWT specifications, while
   others are specific for network tokens.

5.1.1.  'iss' (Issuer) field

   The "iss" (issuer) field identifies the principal that issued the
   token.  For example, the issuer might be the name of the network
   operator that offers the service of interest.  The processing of this
   claim is generally application specific.

5.1.2.  "sub" (Subject) field

   The "sub" (subject) field identifies the principal that is the
   subject of the token.  This could be a subscriber id, or the name of
   an application.  The subject value MUST either be scoped to be
   locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.
   The processing of this claim is generally application specific.

5.1.3.  "exp" (Expiration Time) field

   The "exp" (expiration time) field identifies the expiration time on
   or after which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The
   processing of the "exp" field requires that the current date/time
   MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.
   Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than
   a few minutes, to account for clock skew.  The "exp" field can be
   used to reduce the probability of replay attacks, restrict service
   access to a certain period, or to force users to refresh
   authentication credentials.

5.1.4.  "iat" (Issued At) field

   The "iat" (issued at) field identifies the time at which the token
   was issued or generated.  This field can be used to determine the age
   of the token, and can be used along or instead of the "exp" field.

5.1.5.  "nti" field (Network Token ID) field

   The "nti" field provides a nonce-like value for the token.  The
   identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that there
   is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally
   assigned to a different data object; if the application uses multiple
   issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values produced by
   different issuers as well.  The "nti" field can be used to prevent
   the token from being replayed.

Internet-Draft                networktokens                   April 2020


5.1.6.  "bip" field (Bound IP) field

   The "bip" (Bound IP) field bounds the use of the token to a specific
   IP address.  This can prevent third parties from reusing the token in
   a different context.

5.2.  Network Token Format

   A token consists of the following fields (Figure X):

   o  Reflect Type (4-bits): Indicates reflection properties for the
      token.

      *  0x0: Token is inserted by the origin of this flow.  No
         reflection needed.

      *  0x1: Token is inserted by the origin of this flow.  Reflect at
         receiver.

      *  0x2: Reflected token.

      *  0x3-0xf: Reserved

   o  Token Descriptor ID (28-bits): An ID that helps the network decide
      whether and how to interpret tokens.  Descriptor IDs are
      registered in the "Token Descriptor ID" registry (MSB = 0) or
      private (MSB equals 1).  For private descriptor IDs, the definer
      of the value needs to take reasonable precautions to make sure
      they are in control of the part of the namespace they use (e.g.,
      by using a OUI prefix).  A token descriptor might just indicate
      that the token payload is a JWT, or point to a structure that
      holds keys and other information to interpret a token.

   o  Token Payload: Depending on the application, the token payload
      might be a self-contained JWT or CWT (as plaintext, signed, or
      encrypted), a set of TLV-encoded values, or has its own custom
      format.

   The length of the token is arbitrary, but must follow the limitations
   imposed by the protocol it is encapsulated.  For example, if the
   token is carried as an IPv6 hop-by-hop option, the total length of
   the token cannot exceed 256 bytes.

6.  Example Network Tokens

   This section discusses example network tokens and how they can serve
   specific use cases.

6.1.  Firewall Whitelist Token

   A firewall token can be used to whitelist traffic from trusted
   applications.

   The following example verifies that a network flow is coming from
   "The Godfather App".

   The token payload is encoded as a JWT, and encapsulated as a TLS
   Extension attached in a Server Hello Message.

   The Reflect Type is 0x00 (i.e., this is the origin flow and peers
   should not reflect it), with the expectation that firewalls can setup
   appropriate state for the reverse flow as well.  The Token Descriptor
   ID is 0x03, which might represent a registered value for firewall
   tokens.

   The JWT encodes the following object.

   The header of the JWT has the following fields:

   {"alg":"ES256", "kid":"N6fr1MDrEuu1eXRkFbcpX4WY62SKN7TKrhYf9PfJEd8"}


   The token is signed using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm, and the public key can be looked-up in a pre-defined
   database using the "kid" thumbprint.

   The JWT payload has the following fields:

Internet-Draft                networktokens                   April 2020


{"sub":"The Godfather App", "iat":1588116732, "exp":1588117732,"bip":"140.54.35.194"}

   The token is created by the app provider.  It states that this flow
   originates from "The Godfather App", along with the time that it was
   created and when it expires.  The token is signed with the app
   provider's public key, and any network can verify this through the
   attached signature.  The token is also bound to a specific IP
   address, and therefore cannot be reused in a different context.  For
   example, the application provider could configure all exit gateways
   to attach a token for all outgoing flows.

6.2.  Low-latency Token

   A low-latency token is used to access a custom QoS SLA from a mobile
   operator tailored for video communications.  This is an application-
   agnostic service, i.e., users can use it for any traffic they want.

   The token payload is encoded as a JWT, and can be inserted to STUN
   (as STUN attributes) or IPv6 packets (as IPv6 Hop-by-Hop extension
   header).

   The Reflect Type is 0x1, i.e., peers should reflect the token to
   setup state for the reverse flow.  The Token Descriptor ID is 0x01,
   stating that the token payload is a JWT object.

   The header of the JWT has the following fields:

   {'alg':'dir','enc':"A256CBC-HS512", 'app_id':14098715987234}

   The token is generated by the operator, and signed with the AES-256
   algorith, using a customer-specific symmetric key.  The app_id points
   is a local identifier, that the operator has associated with its own
   services.

   The payload of the token has the following fields, requesting for
   low-latency treatment, and bounding the start and end time of the
   token.  It also has a unique identifier to allow revocation.

 {'srv':'lowlatency', 'nti': 5871234, iat':1588116732, 'exp':1588203132}

   Each token is valid for 24 hours.  As the encryption key is bound to
   a specific user, it cannot be used by another context.  The Operating
   System (or an agent) in the user's device can request a token, and
   grant it to specific applications based on a user's request.  Users
   can revoke access by telling an operator to blacklist the nti
   associated with this token.

   Besides accessing a low-latency service, this token serves two
   requirements: * it is application agnostic and can be used for any
   application a user wants * it preserves privacy.  There is no
   indication about specific applications, and no identifier that can be
   linked to a user.

7.  Network Tokens and Encapsulating protocols

7.1.  Network Tokens as a TLS Extension

7.2.  Network Tokens as a STUN Attribute

7.3.  Network Tokens as an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Extension Header

8.  Implementation Considerations

   Things to discuss

   o  Token -> DiffServ Mapping

   o  Token reflect and reverse flow

   o  Not every node needs to interpret tokens

   o  Multiple networks / multiple recipients

9.  Security Considerations

   As any cryptographic application, it is important for users of
   network tokens applications to protect asymmetric private and
   symmetric secret keys, and employ countermeasures to various attacks.

   The security of network tokens relies upon on the protections offered
   by the underlying signing and encryption technologies.  It is
   therefore recommended that implementations of network tokens use
   existing and well-understood cryptographic frameworks (like JOSE and
   COSE) to protect tokens, or careful consider security implications if
   they provide their own format.

   Network tokens may require processing in software, as current
   hardware platforms do not support cryptographic capabilities.  This
   might impose a security risk and exposure to an attack, as traffic
   could be diverted towards the slow path, and in return degrade the
   overall performance of a node.  It is recommended that
   implementations adequately account for such scenarios, either by
   setting a rate-limit to packets that go through a slow path or
   ensuring that the overall functionality is not affected.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  Token Descriptor ID Registry

   This section establishes the IANA "Network Token Descriptor ID"
   registry for token descriptors.  The registry records the descriptor
   ID and a reference to the specification that defines it.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC5226] basis
   after a three-week review period, on the advice of one or more
   Designated Experts.  However, to allow for the allocation of values
   prior to publication, the Designated Experts may approve registration
   once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.

   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the
   registration description is clear.
